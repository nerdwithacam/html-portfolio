 <p>The best part of Nolan's Cape Crusader trilogy <br />
    and the best Batman film ever, <br />
    (I've watched it at least 10 times)</p>

 <li><h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3></li>

 <p>For me, it's definitely one of the best films. <br />
    The film is over 30 years old, and yet I can watch it again and again. <br /> 
    Definitely worth recommending.</p>

<li><h3>Interstellar</h3></li>

<p>There's not much to say except: This film is a must-see! <br />
   There's simply nothing to criticize about this masterpiece. <br />
   The blend of breathtaking visual splendor, a profound story, <br />
   and brilliant performances makes this film an absolute classic.</p>
