    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>My Name is Farhan Abbasi. I am 31 years old. I am a Network Engineer by profession. <br />
      I have worked and managed Computer Systems for MultiNational Corporations for almost a decade. <br />
      I have recently developed an interest in Web Development. For that very reason I got myseld enrolled <br />
      in an online course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST7MT290425G1">Udemy.com</a></p>

    <p>As a seasoned network professional, I have recently embarked on a journey to expand my technical horizons by <br />
      transitioning into a full stack developer. With a strong foundation in networking, and a computer science background, <br />
      I have begun to master front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while diving deep into back-end frameworks <br />
      and databases such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My ambition is to bridge the gap between infrastructure and <br />
      development, aiming to build seamless, scalable web applications from the ground up. <br />
      I envision myself leading cross-functional tech teams in the near future, blending my networking expertise with <br />
      full stack capabilities to drive innovative digital solutions.</p>
